In the end of time
There was a man who knew the road
And the writing, was written on the stone

In the ancient time
An artist led the way
But no one, seemed to understand

In his heart he knew
The artist must be true
But the legend, of the rent was way past due

Well you think you'll be just fine...without me, but your mine!
You think you can, kick me out of the band

Well there's just one problem there
The band is mine
How can you kick me out...of what is mine

You're not hardcore
Unless you live hardcore

Well you're not hardcore
(No you're not hardcore)
Unless you live hardcore
(Unless you live hardcore)
But the legend of the rent was way hardcore
